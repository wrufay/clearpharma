### ClearPharma Chronic Solutions: bridging the gap between **_patients_** and **_pharmacists._**

Made for UW Technology in Pharmacy hackathon by Fay Wu, Kaixi Zhu, Gloria Wang, Frank Xu and Erin Guo

**THE ISSUE**

- 30% of patients in Canada don't take their medication as prescribed.
- 5.4% of all hospitalizations were due to medication nonadherence
- $1.6 BILLION Canadian dollars annual cost burden.

The status quo fails as a result of gaps in education, a lack of tools to detect risks, and a low adherence rate.

**HOW CLEARPHARMA ADDRESSES IT**

ClearPharma was made to **facilitate patient-pharmacist communication.** There are three factors that allow our system to work seamlessly:

1. The PATIENT: Seek direct help from the service team about any issues they're facing, and communicate with pharmacist, full clarity.
2. The SERVICE TEAM: Provide support for patients 24/7 and act as the mediators who can easily connect patients with the pharmacist or doctors.
3. The PHARMACIST: Generate referal code for patient registration. View patient profiles and chat with service team.

**KEY FEATURES**

- Stability monitoring
- Routing support
- Chatbox

Our target focus is communication and transparency, two fundamental needs in pharmacy that still aren’t efficiently addressed.

**TECH STACK**

- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Firebase, Google Gemini API
